## 📖 Overview

This project implements a social media backend as **4 independently
deployable microservices** behind a single **API Gateway**,
communicating asynchronously via **RabbitMQ** and using **Redis** for
both caching and distributed rate limiting. Each service owns its own
MongoDB database (database-per-service pattern), so services can be
developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

It was built to go deep on questions that don't come up in a monolith:
_How do services talk to each other without being tightly coupled? How
do you rate-limit fairly across multiple instances? How do you cache
safely when writes happen in a different service than reads?_

_Client requests flow top-down through the Gateway. Post-service writes
flow sideways into RabbitMQ, which Media and Search consume
independently --- so a slow Search index update never blocks a post
being created. Redis sits underneath the Gateway, Identity, and Post
services for rate limiting and caching (Media has no Redis usage; Search
has it scaffolded but not yet wired in)._

**Request flow:** every request enters through the API Gateway, which
verifies the JWT and proxies to the correct downstream service. **Event
flow:** when a post is created or deleted, the Post service publishes an
event to a RabbitMQ exchange instead of calling Media/Search directly
--- those services consume the event independently, so a slow or down
Search service never blocks post creation.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

---

Layer Technology

---

Runtime Node.js, Express.js

Database MongoDB (Mongoose) --- one database
per service

Messaging RabbitMQ (publish/subscribe,
exchange-based routing)

Caching & Rate Limiting Redis (`ioredis`,
`rate-limit-redis`,
`rate-limiter-flexible`)

Auth JWT (access + refresh tokens,
refresh-token rotation)

Media Storage Cloudinary

Containerization Docker, Docker Compose

CI/CD GitHub Actions

---

---

## 🧩 Services

---

Service Responsibility

---

**API Gateway** Single entry point, JWT
verification, request proxying,
global Redis-backed rate limiting

**Identity Service** Registration, login, logout,
refresh-token rotation, IP-based
rate limiting on sensitive routes

**Post Service** Create/read/delete posts,
Redis-cached reads, publishes post
lifecycle events

**Media Service** Media upload to Cloudinary,
consumes post-deletion events to
clean up orphaned media

**Search Service** Consumes post events to keep a
search index in sync

---

---

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

- **Event-driven decoupling** --- Post service never calls
  Media/Search directly; it publishes events to RabbitMQ and lets
  consumers react independently. A downstream service being slow or
  offline doesn't block post creation.
- **Cache-aside pattern with invalidation** --- Post reads are cached
  in Redis (5-min TTL on feed pages, 1-hour on individual posts); the
  cache is explicitly invalidated on writes to avoid serving stale
  data.
- **Distributed rate limiting** --- Rate limit counters live in Redis
  rather than in-memory, so limits are enforced correctly even if a
  service runs multiple instances. Registration has a stricter,
  dedicated limiter to reduce abuse.
- **Refresh-token rotation** --- Every refresh call invalidates the
  old refresh token and issues a new one, limiting the blast radius of
  a leaked token.
- **Database-per-service** --- Each service owns its own MongoDB
  database and connection string, avoiding cross-service coupling at
  the data layer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- MongoDB Atlas connection string (or local MongoDB)
- Cloudinary account (for media uploads)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ahadx488/social-media-microservices.git
cd social-media-microservices

# 2. Copy the example env file in each service and fill in your own values
cp api-gateway/.env.example api-gateway/.env
cp identity-services/.env.example identity-services/.env
cp post-service/.env.example post-service/.env
cp media-service/.env.example media-service/.env
cp search-service/.env.example search-service/.env
#    Fill in your MongoDB Atlas URI, JWT secret, and Cloudinary credentials in each

# 3. Build and run all services
docker-compose up -d --build

# 4. Confirm everything is running
docker-compose ps
```

The API Gateway will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Redis and
RabbitMQ run as internal containers and don't need separate setup.

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

This project was tested locally using **Postman** for API requests and
**MongoDB Atlas** for verifying persisted data across services.
